Converted original CherryTree file to Obsidian format. For best results, download the four numbered markdown files into a directory titled, "PenTesting Methodology", or something similar. Then open that folder as a vault in Obsidian. Each of the four files should then be available as individual tabs within the vault.

HTTP links were anchored to text using Obsidian's linking syntax, but the links are otherwise the same. Some additional links were added to software repos and/or the Kali Linux Tools site when the software is first mentioned throughout the text.

Light editing was performed to enhance readability after converting the text into Obsidian markdown format. Otherwise, original spellings and phrasing was left intact. Some references within the text are now outdated--new references were added when they could be found. 

I'm still new to Obsidian, so apologies for any errors introduced during the conversion. Please feel free to update, correct, or fork it. There are a lot of good resources within for studying penetration testing and preparing for the OSCP. Many thanks to QuirkyKirkHax for sharing his notes!!

(Leaving his original CherryTree file intact as some folks may decide they prefer it to the Obsidian version--you can, of course, just get it from his original repo too.)

notes and ramblings from my OSCP/PenTesting Studies

I can't imagine this will be particularly helpful/useful, but I am sharing my notes here for anyone who wants 'em.

The .ctb file is for use with Cherrytree, which is where I did the vast majority of my note taking...If someone wants to convert it to obsidian or something, be my guest...

Note that there may be references to outside materials, and language may be coarse at times.  I wasn't really planning on sharing these until some folks asked....So forgive me.
