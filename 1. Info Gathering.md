## nmap

**Useful `nmap` tags**
-sS (SYN Scan)
-sU (UDP Scan)
-sT (TCP Scan)
-sV (Version enum)
-O (OS Fingerprinting)
-Pn (Assume host is up)
-p (Ports)
-A (runs all scans)
-n (No DNS)
-T 0-5 (Timing of scans, 0 is fastest, 3 is default)


Typical `nmap` scans for exams/HTB:
`sudo nmap -sSV -p- -Pn -n [TARGET]`
`sudo nmap -sUV -p- -Pn -n [TARGET]`

Note: I tend to use autorecon with the output folder pulled up in atom/sublime, makes it easier to read through.  Could probably use Obsidian too if that's your jam

## OSINT Tools

[Netcraft](https://www.netcraft.com/) is good to dig into DNS stuff
So is Whois - There is both a website called [Whois](https://www.whois.com/whois/) and a command and response protocol implemented in Linux and maintained by [Marco d'Itri](https://github.com/rfc1036/whois)

[Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng) is a suite of tools designed for this. It is also included in the [Kali Linux tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/recon-ng/).

[Google hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking) is also great. (Link to Wikipedia page.)

[GitHub](https://github.com/) might also provide usernames or passwords.

[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) is fun to find public facing assets.

You can use [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) to automate OSINT on user emails.  Recommended!!!! (It is also included in the [Kali Linux tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/theharvester/) and on [PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/theHarvester/).)

[Social Searcher](https://www.social-searcher.com/) is a site that allows for deep dives into folks' socials

[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) might be good too if you can pinpoint a user, you could search through posts and determine some stuff

[OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/)states its intention as, "...to help people find free OSINT resources."
